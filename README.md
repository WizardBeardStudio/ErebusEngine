# Overview

`Erebus Engine` takes inspiration from classic engines and games like `Quake III`.

Specifically, this project is built around an `Event Driven Architecture` implemented as a `Shared Bus` for unified systems communications.

## What?

`Erebus Engine` is a free, open source RPG engine for `Unity v6.3 LTS`.

## Why?

This project explores `Software Architecture Patterns` along with `Data Structure & Algorithms` applied to game development.

## What about the Name?

The word `Erebus` signifies a primordial god of darkness, born from chaos, and consort to `Nyx`.

In other words, we enter the darkness of the unknown to push ourselves beyond our limits.
